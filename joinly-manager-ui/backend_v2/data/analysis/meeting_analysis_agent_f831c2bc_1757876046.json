  "summary": "The meeting focused on the low participation and disengagement issues experienced during the last club event. Despite expecting 80 participants and confirming 65, only 20 showed up. This highlights a problem with how potential attendees are approached and their commitment. Additionally, a significant issue was raised regarding the lack of commitment from event coordinators themselves, with volunteers signing up but not fulfilling their duties, possibly due to the incentive of free attendance. The discussion emphasized the need to re-evaluate recruitment strategies and implement measures to ensure both attendee and volunteer accountability for future events.",
  "key_points": [
    "Rethink the approach to engaging people for event participation due to lack of truthful responses.",
    "Investigate why participation falls and what measures were taken (or not taken) to prevent it.",
    "Acknowledge the success in managing and engaging the 20 attendees despite overall event issues.",
    "Recognize that low participation is a recurring problem that needs to be addressed for current and upcoming events.",
    "Address the issue of coordinators not showing up properly for events after volunteering.",
    "Hypothesize that offering free attendance to volunteers might be a reason for people signing up but not performing tasks.",
    "Develop a strategy to ensure volunteers actively participate and complete their assigned tasks."
